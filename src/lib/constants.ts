/**
 * Domain-meaningful literal constants for vaultkit. Names that recur
 * across multiple files (vault file paths, layout directories, the
 * vault-name length limit) live here so a single edit changes them
 * everywhere — and so a typo in one site can't silently desync from
 * the rest of the codebase.
 *
 * Not in this file (deliberately):
 *  - Git refs (`'main'`, `'origin'`, `'@{u}'`) — Git spec terms.
 *  - One-shot external URLs (`https://cli.github.com`) — extracting
 *    them obscures intent at the call site.
 *  - Configurable timeouts (already env-overridable).
